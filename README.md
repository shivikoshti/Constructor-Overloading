# Overloading-
## Theory:
Function overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters. When a function name is overloaded with different jobs it is called Function Overloading. f multiple functions having same name but parameters of the functions should be different is known as Function Overloading.
If we have to perform only one operation and having same name of the functions increases the readability of the program.
### Rules of function overloading :
Different parameters or three different conditions :

These functions have different parameter type
sum(int a, int b)

sum(double a, double b)

These functions have a different number of parameters
sum(int a, int b)

sum(int a, int b, int c)

These functions have a different sequence of parameters
sum(int a, double b)

sum(double a, int b)
